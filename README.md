## ðŸ§¬ Overview

Brain cancers like glioblastoma (GBM) and brain metastases (BrMET) display spatial heterogeneity in neoantigen expression and T cell responses. In this study, we present a **mechanistic and stochastic mathematical model** that describes how neoantigenâ€“TCR interactions and stochastic dynamics within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) give rise to observed T cell clone size distributions.

Our model accurately captures:
- The heavy-tailed distribution of T cell clone sizes in different spatial tumor regions.
- Higher T cell proliferation rates in BrMET vs GBM patients.
- Suppressive effects of macrophages on T cell expansion.
- Neoantigen-specific T cell responses in personalized vaccine settings.
