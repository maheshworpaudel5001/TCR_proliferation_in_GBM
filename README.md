## 🧬 Overview

Brain cancers like glioblastoma (GBM) and brain metastases (BrMET) display spatial heterogeneity in neoantigen expression and T cell responses. In this study, we present a **mechanistic and stochastic mathematical model** that describes how neoantigen–TCR interactions and stochastic dynamics within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) give rise to observed T cell clone size distributions.

Our model accurately captures:
- The heavy-tailed distribution of T cell clone sizes in different spatial tumor regions.
- Higher T cell proliferation rates in BrMET vs GBM patients.
- Suppressive effects of macrophages on T cell expansion.
- Neoantigen-specific T cell responses in personalized vaccine settings.

## 🧪 Features

- 📊 Predicts clone size distributions using neoantigen and TCR data.
- 🔄 Quantifies stochastic proliferation dynamics in TME and in peripheral blood.
- 🧠 Compares T cell expansion in GBM vs BrMET patients.
- 💉 Ranks neoantigen peptides by their ability to induce T cell proliferation—relevant for vaccine design.

## 📊 Example Use-Cases

- Simulate T cell expansion from real or synthetic neoantigen–TCR data.
- Predict the most immunogenic neoantigens for vaccine design.
- Analyze clone size distributions in different tumor regions.
